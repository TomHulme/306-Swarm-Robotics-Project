Instructions on how to install and run our ROS project! | Our Wiki, which contains helpful information about the project.

# Project Information

This github page contains the work of 7 individuals who attempted to work as a team, learning to use two completely new systems to produce a simulation of a farm.

You can follow progress, track commits, and even view documentation - all right here. Simply follow the quick links above to get started!

# Authors

Every project needs a solid team behind it. Where ever possible we strived to work as a team, regularly meeting and discussing options for our project, and flicking through design decisions.

[You can view a list of the contributors here!](https://github.com/TomHulme/306-Swarm-Robotics-Project/graphs/contributors)

NOTE: This view will only show the lines people have pushed to master! They may have done other work elsewhere which may not be shown here.

# Thanks

We would like to Acknowledge our awesome lecturer Bruce MacDonald! Without whom this project wouldn't exist. His lectures and guidance helped us through tough times. And this totally isn't here hoping he reads it and give us all an A+... But you can if you want to :)
